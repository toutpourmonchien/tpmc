To update shadowbox module just proceed as for any other module. Run update.php.


UPDATE FROM 7.x-3.x to 7.x-4.x
==============================

There is not available update path from 7.x-3.x version to 7.x-4.x version.
To proceed to that upgrade you must do the following:

1) Run update.php.
2) Review any content type where you have an image field using shadowbox format and
 select shadowbox again as the format because after the update the format is resetted
 to the default image format. You just need to select shadowbox format and the config
 options for the format should be remembered. Review the options too anyway and save.
3) For any view where you have an image field using shadowbox format proceed as in 2.
 Select shadowbox again as the format, check the config and save.
